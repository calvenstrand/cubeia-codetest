# Cubeia Code Test

This project is a code test written for a job application at Cubeia. It is a React application that displays information about games, studios, and tags. The application allows users to filter games based on selected studios, currencies, and tags.

## Take aways

While I’m pleased with the overall outcome of my code test, there are a couple of areas that I would have approached differently given more time.

- Testing: I typically prioritize writing unit tests, as they are crucial for ensuring code reliability and maintainability. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I wasn't able to include them this time. 

- Git Commit Quality: I’m very comfortable using Git and normally follow best practices in a professional environment, including working with feature branches and crafting clear, descriptive commit messages. However, in this instance, I combined multiple changes into larger commits, which impacted clarity. I was focused on being creative with the solution, which led to this oversight.

I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my work.
